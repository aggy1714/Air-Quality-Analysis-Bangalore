# Air Quality Analysis of Bangalore

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 5 years of air quality data in Bangalore, focusing on the levels of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO. Additionally, it examines the impact of weather and Indian festivals on air quality.

- Indian festivals data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keagle/list-of-indian-festivals-for-2022/data)

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Tableau:** Data visualization and dashboard creation

## Analysis and Findings
- Created new tables, and calculated monthly deviations, and moving percentages.
- Connected MySQL with Tableau to visualize pollutant levels, temperature impacts, and festival effects on air quality.
- Analysed AQI across various seasons.
- Used Tableau forecast to predict the next year's pollutant levels.
- Key insights:
- 1. We could see a significant relationship between the temperature and the pollutant level.
  2. Summer is when we noticed an all-time low pollutant level.
  3. Were able to analyze how different festivals affect the AQI levels.
  4. We noticed the lower the temperature, the higher the AQI levels.
